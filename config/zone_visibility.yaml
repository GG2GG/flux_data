# Zone Visibility Configuration
# Research-backed visibility factors for different shelf positions

version: "1.0"

# ============================================================================
# VISIBILITY FACTORS BY ZONE TYPE
# ============================================================================
# Based on eye-tracking studies, retail placement research, and
# shopper behavior analysis (2020-2024)
#
# Visibility Factor: Multiplier representing % of shoppers who notice products
# - 1.0 = baseline (regular shelf visibility)
# - >1.0 = enhanced visibility
# - <1.0 = reduced visibility

zone_visibility:
  endcap:
    factor: 1.5
    visibility_pct: 90
    source: "Retail research - end-cap displays"
    confidence: "high"
    description: "End-cap displays with 90% shopper visibility"
    research_notes: |
      End-caps capture attention from multiple aisles. Studies show 90% of
      shoppers notice end-cap products, resulting in 50% lift in sales.

  checkout:
    factor: 1.6
    visibility_pct: 95
    source: "Impulse buy zone research"
    confidence: "high"
    description: "Checkout displays with 95% exposure"
    research_notes: |
      Checkout zones have near-universal exposure. 95% of shoppers pass through,
      with 60% lift due to both visibility and impulse buying behavior.

  eye_level:
    factor: 1.2
    visibility_pct: 80
    source: "Eye-tracking studies"
    confidence: "high"
    description: "Eye-level shelving (4.5-5.5 ft height)"
    research_notes: |
      Eye-level placement (4.5-5.5 ft) captures 80% of shopper attention.
      The "golden zone" for product placement, 20% lift over baseline.

  mid_shelf:
    factor: 1.0
    visibility_pct: 60
    source: "Baseline reference"
    confidence: "high"
    description: "Standard mid-shelf positioning"
    research_notes: |
      Mid-level shelving serves as baseline. 60% shopper visibility,
      moderate reach effort required.

  low_shelf:
    factor: 0.8
    visibility_pct: 30
    source: "Bottom shelf research"
    confidence: "high"
    description: "Bottom shelf positioning (below 3 ft)"
    research_notes: |
      Bottom shelves have reduced visibility (30% attention). Requires
      bending to reach, 20% penalty compared to baseline.

  top_shelf:
    factor: 0.85
    visibility_pct: 40
    source: "High shelf research"
    confidence: "medium"
    description: "Top shelf positioning (above 6 ft)"
    research_notes: |
      Top shelves harder to reach, 40% visibility. 15% penalty due to
      vertical eye movement and reach difficulty.

  regular_shelf:
    factor: 1.0
    visibility_pct: 60
    source: "Standard positioning"
    confidence: "high"
    description: "Regular shelf space (various heights)"
    research_notes: |
      Regular shelf positions average 60% visibility across all heights.

# ============================================================================
# CUSTOM LOCATION OVERRIDES (Optional)
# ============================================================================
# Override visibility for specific locations with unique characteristics

custom_locations:
  # Example: Enhanced lighting installation
  # A001:
  #   visibility_override: 1.3
  #   reason: "Premium lighting and signage installed"
  #   effective_date: "2024-11-01"

  # Example: Obstructed view
  # A005:
  #   visibility_override: 0.7
  #   reason: "Partially obstructed by support column"
  #   effective_date: "2024-01-01"

# ============================================================================
# CATEGORY-SPECIFIC VISIBILITY ADJUSTMENTS (Optional)
# ============================================================================
# Some product categories perform differently at various heights

category_adjustments:
  enabled: false

  # Example adjustments:
  # categories:
  #   "Snacks":
  #     eye_level_bonus: 1.1  # Kids' snacks at lower eye level
  #     checkout_bonus: 1.2   # Impulse snacks at checkout
  #
  #   "Dairy":
  #     low_shelf_penalty: 0.9  # Heavy items acceptable lower
  #
  #   "Personal Care":
  #     eye_level_bonus: 1.15  # Comparison shopping benefits

# ============================================================================
# VALIDATION RULES
# ============================================================================
validation:
  # Visibility factors must be within reasonable range
  min_factor: 0.5   # 50% of baseline
  max_factor: 2.0   # 2x baseline

  # Warn if custom overrides deviate significantly
  deviation_warning_threshold: 0.3  # 30% from zone default

# ============================================================================
# NOTES
# ============================================================================
# - Visibility factors are multiplicative with other ROI components
# - Based on industry research, not store-specific observations
# - Custom overrides should be used sparingly and documented
# - Update research citations as new studies become available
